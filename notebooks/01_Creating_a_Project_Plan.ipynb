    "1. **Calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET),** or the amount of energy available to vaporize water. The fraction of this energy that is consumed to vaporize water is the actual evapotranspiration (AET). We'll obtain consistent, weekly estimates of both PET and AET from NASA's MODIS MOD16 product [(recall that we used these data in Module 3)](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M3-Open-Science-for-Water-Resources).\n",
    "2. **Define the available soil water.** We can calculate soil water (mm) if we know the **volumetric water content (VWC)** and the **rooting depth.** We'll obtain VWC from a NASA satellite-based soil moisture dataset and we'll use representative rooting depths from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
    "3. **Calculate the critical soil water level.** This is the amount of water that is *more than enough* to satisfy the crop. It is also the minimum amount of water required to ensure that all of the available energy to vaporize water (i.e., PET) is used. We'll compute this based on the soil water-holding capacity and other coefficients defined by the FAO.\n",
    "4. **Calculate the plant available water (PAW);** this is the amount of water the plant can actually use and it is determined by the water balance. We'll have to compute the available soil water at each time step, then add the precipitation (if any), to compute the new PAW at each time step. We'll use precipitation data from NASA.\n",
    "5. **Compute the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI),** an estimate of how much of the plant's water needs have been satisfied. Low values would indicate the plant is water stressed."
