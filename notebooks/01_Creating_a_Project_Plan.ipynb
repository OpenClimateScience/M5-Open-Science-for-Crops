    "1. **Calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET),** or the amount of energy available to vaporize water. The fraction of this energy that is consumed to vaporize water is the actual evapotranspiration (AET). We'll obtain consistent, weekly estimates of both PET and AET from NASA's VIIRS VNP16 product, which uses the same algorithm as MODIS MOD16 [(recall that we used these data in Module 3)](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M3-Open-Science-for-Water-Resources).\n",
    "2. **Define the available soil water.** We can calculate soil water (mm) if we know the **volumetric water content (VWC)** and the **rooting depth.** We'll approximate VWC based on a simplified, annual water balance. We'll use representative rooting depths from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
    "3. **Calculate the critical soil water level.** This is the amount of water that is *more than enough* to satisfy the crop. It is also the minimum amount of water required to ensure that all of the available energy to vaporize water (i.e., PET) is used. We'll compute this based on the soil water-holding capacity and other coefficients defined by the FAO.\n",
    "4. **Calculate the plant available water (PAW);** this is the amount of water the plant can actually use and it is determined by the water balance. We'll have to compute the available soil water at each time step, then add the precipitation (if any), to compute the new PAW at each time step. We'll use precipitation data from NASA.\n",
    "5. **Compute the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI),** an estimate of how much of the plant's water needs have been satisfied. Low values would indicate the plant is water stressed."

This version of `numpy`, `1.26.3`, has its own software dependencies. Most importantly, `numpy` requires Python, and version `1.26.3` was created to work only with certain versions of Python. **How can we make sure we install both the right version of `numpy` *and* the right version of Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`pixi` and many other package managers handles these situations seamlessly. However, in order to make sure `pixi` has all the required information about potential version conflicts, **we need to tell `pixi` to install all the packages with potential conflicts at the same time.** In this example, that means telling it to install both Python but also a version of `numpy` that is *less than version 2.0.*\n",
