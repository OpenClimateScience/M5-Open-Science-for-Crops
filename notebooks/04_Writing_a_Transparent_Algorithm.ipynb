    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to compute the water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI). Because WRSI is a moderately complex algorithm, it's important that we write computer code that satisfies the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code should correctly implement the WRSI algorithm, of course.\n",
    "- Anyone reading the code should be able to understand what each line of code does.\n",
    "- Each part of the code should be clearly related to a specific part of the algorithm's written description, as applicable.\n",
    "- Appropriate physical units for inputs, outputs, and important intermediate variables should be made clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll see examples of code that satisfies these criteria, making it easy for humans to read and to verify that the code is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The meaning of \"correct\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential that our computer code *correctly* implement the algorithm or model we're working with. By \"correctly,\" we mean that the computer code does what is intended. We do *not* mean that the results it produces are accurate when compared with some objective state or real-world measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy is important, it is secondary to correct implementation. After all, if our computer model is both incorrect and inaccurate, it will not be possible to improve its accuracy until we have a correct implementation. Imagine you are try to figure out if there is a problem with your car's tail lights. As you are standing behind the car, you ask your friend to switch on the right-turn signal, but your friend turns the left-turn signal on instead. If your friend isn't turning on the correct signal, it's going to be difficult to figure out what problem you might have with the tail lights. Therefore, a correct implementation is necessary to diagnose what needs to be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea of a correct implementation assumes there is some *authoritative description* of the algorithm, usually a written document in a natural language.** While a software implementation of an algorithm can be authoritative, we usually start with a written description of an algorithm in a white paper or peer-review publication."

If the maximum rooting depth of wheat is about 1.5 m ([Fan et al. 2016, *Field Crops Research*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.02.013)), then this corresponds to:\n",
