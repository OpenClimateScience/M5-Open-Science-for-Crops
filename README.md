[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/967615825.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18393840) M5: Open Science for Crop Conditions ==================================== > How can NASA datasets be used to map crop conditions? The fifth module of our [open climate-science curriculum](https://openclimatescience.github.io/curriculum) focuses on how to begin a reproducible computational science project, using crop conditions as a thematic example. **At the end of this module, you should be able to:** - Access and utilize satellite-based datasets on plant productivity, condition, and evapotranspiration. - Compute an index of the water requirements for agricultural crops Contents --------------- 1. [Creating a Project Plan](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M5-Open-Science-for-Crops/blob/main/notebooks/01_Creating_a_Project_Plan.ipynb) 2. [Creating a Reproducible Research Environment](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M5-Open-Science-for-Crops/blob/main/notebooks/02_Creating_a_Reproducible_Research_Environment.ipynb) 3. [Setting Up Data Processing Workflows](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M5-Open-Science-for-Crops/blob/main/notebooks/03_Setting_Up_Data_Processing_Workflows.ipynb) 4. [Writing a Transparent Algorithm](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M5-Open-Science-for-Crops/blob/main/notebooks/04_Writing_a_Transparent_Algorithm.ipynb) Getting Started --------------- [See our installation guide here.](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/M1-Open-Climate-Data/blob/main/HOW_TO_INSTALL.md) You can run the notebooks in this repository using [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) or as [a VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). Once your container is running, launch Jupyter Notebook by:
sh
# Create your own password when prompted
jupyter server password

# Then, launch Jupyter Notebook; enter your password when prompted
jupyter notebook
**The Python libraries required for the exercises can be installed using the pip package manager:**
sh
pip install xarray netcdf4 dask
Learning Outcomes ----------------- This course covers the following [Core Competencies in Computational Data Science:](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/Core-Competencies/blob/main/ScienceCore-Competencies.md) - Records relationships between code, results, and metadata (CC1.5) - Uses a package manager to install and manage software dependencies (CC1.10) - Can scale up a computational workflow (CC2.6) - Understands software releases and versioning (CC4.4) **In addition, learners will see how to:** - Use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to manage a software environment and dependencies - Use [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) to automate reproducible tasks - Calculate the Water Requirements Satisfaction Index Acknowledgements ---------------- This curriculum was enabled by a grant from NASA's Transition to Open Science (TOPS) Training program (80NSSC23K0864), part of [NASA's TOPS Program](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/)
